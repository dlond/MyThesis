This Thesis is motivated by two problems, each concerning representations (homomorphisms) of groups into a connected reductive algebraic group $G$ over an algebraically closed field $k$. The first problem is due to B. K\"ulshammer and is to do with representations of finite groups in $G$:
\begin{quote}
	Let $\Gamma$ be a finite group and suppose $k$ has characteristic $p$. Let $\Gamma_p$ be a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $\Gamma$ and let $\rho:\Gamma_p\rightarrow G$ be a representation. Are there only finitely many conjugacy classes of representations $\rho':\Gamma\rightarrow G$ whose restriction to $\Gamma_p$ is conjugate to $\rho$?
\end{quote}
The second problem follows the work of M. Liebeck and G. Seitz: describe the representations of connected reductive algebraic $H$ in $G$.
	
These two problems have been settled as long as the characteristic $p$ is large enough but not much is known in the case where the characteristic $p$ is a so called \emph{bad} prime for $G$, which will be the setting for our work.

At the intersection of these two problems lies another problem which we call the algebraic version of K\"ulshammer's question where we no longer suppose $\Gamma$ is finite. This new variation of K\"ulshammer's question is interesting in its own right, and a counterexample may provide insight into K\"ulshammer's original question.

Our approach is to convert these problems into problems in the nonabelian 1-cohomology. Let $K$ be a reductive algebraic group, $P$ a parabolic subgroup of $G$ with Levi subgroup $L<P$, $V$ the unipotent radical of $P$. Let $\rho_0:K\rightarrow L$ be a representation. Then the representations $\rho:K\rightarrow P$ that equal $\rho_0$ under the canonical projection $P\rightarrow L$ are in bijective correspondence with elements of the space of 1-cocycles $Z^1(K, V)$ where $K$ acts on $V$ by $x\cdot v = \rho_0(x)v\rho_0(x)^{-1}$. We can then interpret $P$- and $G$-conjugacy classes of representations in terms of the 1-cohomology $H^1(K, V)$.

We state and prove the conditions under which a collection of representations from $K$ to $P$ is a finite union of conjugacy classes in terms of the 1-cohomology in Theorem \ref{main_thm}.

Unlike other approaches, we work directly with the nonabelian 1-cohomology. Even so, we find that the 1-cocycles in $Z^1(K, V)$ often take values in an abelian subgroup of $V$ (Lemmas \ref{lem:first} and \ref{lem:second}). This is interesting, for the question ``is the restriction map of 1-cohomologies $H^1(H, V) \rightarrow H^1(U, V)$ induced by the inclusion of $U$ in $K$ injective?'' is closely linked to the question of K\"ulshammer, and has positive answer if $V$ is abelian and $H=SL_2(k)$ (Example \ref{eg:sl2ab}).

We show that for $G=B_4$ there is a family of pairwise non-conjugate embeddings of $SL_2$ in $G$, a direction provided by Stewart who proved the result for $G=F_4$. This is important as an example like this is first needed if one hopes to find a counterexample to the algebraic version of K\"ulshammer's question.

I would like to thank the expert guidance, support and patience of my supervisory team, Ben Martin and G\"unter Steinke.

As a part-time student with full-time work commitments, I also owe a lot to my colleagues and supervisors at Weta Digital who have been very generous in affording time off for me make frequent trips from Wellington to Christchurch to meet with my supervisors.

Lastly I would like to thank my friends and family for their support. It is evidence that we have something truly special for you to still be at my side at the end: Lucy Lake-Ryan, my parents Andrea Spain, Doug Spain, Gary Lond and all the Maths and Stats postgrads that have come and gone over my time at the University of Canterbury.

This research could not have been possible without the support of the Marsden grants UOC0501, UOC1009 and UOA1021.
