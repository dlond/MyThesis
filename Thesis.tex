I, DANIEL LOND, declare that this thesis titled, `ON REDUCTIVE SUBGROUPS OF ALGEBRAIC GROUPS AND A QUESTION OF K\"ULSHAMMER' and the work presented in it are my own. I confirm that:

\begin{itemize} 
\item[\tiny{$\blacksquare$}] This work was done wholly or mainly while in candidature for a research degree at this University.
 
\item[\tiny{$\blacksquare$}] Where any part of this thesis has previously been submitted for a degree or any other qualification at this University or any other institution, this has been clearly stated.
 
\item[\tiny{$\blacksquare$}] Where I have consulted the published work of others, this is always clearly attributed.
 
\item[\tiny{$\blacksquare$}] Where I have quoted from the work of others, the source is always given. With the exception of such quotations, this thesis is entirely my own work.
 
\item[\tiny{$\blacksquare$}] I have acknowledged all main sources of help.
 
\item[\tiny{$\blacksquare$}] Where the thesis is based on work done by myself jointly with others, I have made clear exactly what was done by others and what I have contributed myself.

This thesis concerns embeddings of reductive groups $H$ in a reductive group $G$ complementing the work of M. Liebeck and G. Seitz who have determined explicitly the embeddings of arbitrary connected simple groups in $G$ where $G$ is of exceptional type with certain restrictions on the characteristic of the underlying field $k$. We work with low-characteristic (usually $p = 2$ or $p = 3$) where examples are exotic and less is know.

We also investigate a question of B. K\"ulshammer which asks whether there can be only finitely many conjugacy classes of representations $\Gamma \rightarrow G$ from a finite group $\Gamma$ which when restricted to a Sylow $p$-subgroup $\Gamma_p$ hit some fixed class of representations $\Gamma_p \rightarrow G$. A counterexample exists for a particular non-reductive $G$ and we concentrate on the reductive case. We provide a necessary condition for a positive answer to K\"ulshammer's question.

I would like to thank the expert guidance, support and patience of my supervisory team, Ben Martin and G\"unter Steinke.

As a part-time student with full-time work commitments, I also owe a lot to my collegues and supervisors at Weta Digital who have been very generous in affording time off for me make frequent trips from Wellington to Christchurch to meet with my supervisors.

Lastly I would like to thank my friends and family for their support. It is evidence that we have something truly special for you to still be at my side at the end: Lucy Lake-Ryan, my parents Andrea Spain, Doug Spain, Gary Lond and all the Maths and Stats postgrads that have come and gone over my time at the University of Canterbury.
